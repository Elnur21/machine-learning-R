Machine learning with R programming language

1. Read the excel file
2. Create a new variable, call it lithotype based on the values of vsh as follows:

vsh<0.2, “S1”

0.2<vsh<0.4, “S2”

0.4<vsh<0.6, “S3”

0.6<vsh<0.8, “S4”

else “S5”

3. Understand the data’s structure using statistical summaries and data
visualization.

• Dimensions of the dataset.

• Types of the attributes for each variable.

• Peek at the data itself (print first few rows).

• Levels of the class attribute.

• Breakdown of the instances in each class.

• Statistical summary of all attributes.

4. Visualize the dataset

• Draw boxplots of facies vs depth and for lithotypes vs depth. Make sure
you add labels, legends, they must be readable and comment on your
observations

5. Create 3 machine learning models (kNN, SVM, RF) for classification of
facies and lithotypes, compare the results, pick the best and build confidence
that the accuracy is reliable.
